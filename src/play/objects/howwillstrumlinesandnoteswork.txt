Ok so we have a strumline object

When you press it, it should check what notes are closest in time in song

So get all notes and order them by timeInSong, which one has the highest

And then on the press, check if the note with the highest timeInSong is within range of time
And if it is then do check for sick, good, great, bad etc (rankings)
