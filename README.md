# Dance game (working title)

we dancing in this mf

## Modding
You can access the chart editor and create new songs!

You can import an audio file, chart it, import your album cover and then download
In a nifty little zip folder, which you can send and people will be able to port into their game

Sadly the songs you import can't be stored anywhere and you'd have to re-import them anytime you want to play them again (localstorage limitations)
