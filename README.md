## Modding
### Songs
You can access the chart editor to create new songs!
* You can put a custom cover, audio and fill the metadata and all
* This will give you nifty little zip which contains all the files necessary to open the song, the most important of them is the `manifest.toml` file, which points to the files necessary, if you'd like to host this files somewhere so the zip is lighter, you can do that!
