- Fix textbox workings on chart editor so you can put wharever you want and still makes sense
- Think of a way to add the keys for the song tab automatically
- IDEA for custom types in events i could always make them an object, something like { easing: string } and then for adding the ui elements in the event tab i can just check if the type of the value is object and if the keys include easing, then i know to use a carousel because is hardcoded to easing

- Add notifications for song loading and other stuff
- Make better mod system
    What i mean like this is that it adds the songs, noteskins, dancers folder so you can add your stuff and stuff like that yea
- Chart Editor: Make it so the dancer on the corner is also affected by anims like the ones in the events 
- Move some functions like restart song etc to GameState
- Fix some objects that don't get paused with the pause screen
- Playback speed doesn't work at all on gameplay

- Make cursor animation system even BETTER

- Chart Editor: Make camera follow the leading note in a way that it's always in the center of the grid row

- Results: Rehaul it, AGAIN, make it so it smoothly transitions from gameplay
- Results: Add combo and name of the song

- Save: Add unlocked dancers system
- Options: Add something to the noteskins to signify which one is currently selected
